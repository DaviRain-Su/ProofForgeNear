# Direct AccountId-to-NearToken Identity lookup

This closed map uses the legacy/current default-Identity near-sdk-rs bytes for the selected types:
`Prefix4 || Borsh(AccountId)` keys and exact Borsh `u128` values. It writes immediately and does
not model Rust cache/Drop timing, arbitrary keys/values, custom hashers, iteration, or a FT ledger.

AccountIds supplied by NEAR context hosts are nominally valid and have length 2..64. This map
preserves that contract but does not revalidate AccountId syntax for manually constructed values.
